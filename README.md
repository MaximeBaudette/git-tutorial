# Tutorial

The tutorial uses the repository named GIT Tutorial available to all user who have registered to the SmarTS Lab team on Bitbucket.
I also recommend that you read the documentation available https://www.atlassian.com/git/

## Useful Resources
There are a broad range of information available online to learn about GIT

## Preparatory work

- Create a GitHub account
- Setup a GIT client (e.g. SourceTree, GITkraken) and configure it for your identity (provide name and email in the configuration panel)
- Fork the *GIT Tutorial* repository
- Clone it on your local computer

## Tasks

### Simple Commit to the repository

- Check out the *master* branch
- Open the *Test 1.txt* file
  -  Solve the last equation
  -  Write a new **unsolved** equation (for the next participant)
- Commit your work to the repository
- Push your changes to your remote
- Create a Pull-Request (PR) to the main repository
- Follow up on any further instruction

### Contribute to a Pull Request

- Check the existing PR https://github.com/MaximeBaudette/git-tutorial/pull/1
- Check for existing error
- Check out the *example* branch
- Fix the error, write a new wrong answer at the unanswered equation, and write a new equation
- Create a PR to the main repository (to the *example* branch)

### Merge Conflicts

- Check out the *tutorial* branch
- Open the *Test 2.txt* file and solve the equation
- Commit your work to the repository
- Push your changes to your remote
- Pull the *master* branch into your local branch
- Solve the conflicts, and commit the operation
- Open the *Finished Tutorial.md* file, and add your name to the list
- Commit your work and create a pull request to the main repository

I hope this will help you grasp how GIT works. I will have a look at your pull requests and comment back if you did something wrong.
All in all this should take you about 30 minutes (less if you already have installed and configured SourceTree on your computer)
